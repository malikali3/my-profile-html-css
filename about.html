    <i><b><u><h1>A glimpse of myself</h1></u></b></i>

    <br>
    <p>My name is Malik Ali. I have done my Masters in European Project Management and while I was in Austria I got an IT spark and after completing
        my masters I have been pursuing IT career. Coming back to Pakistan I kept the interest on I did an app development course and kept on learning about programming on my own.
   I am teaching student how to code and I am also training teachers but parallel to that I am also learning more about programming.
